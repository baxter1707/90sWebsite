      <p>My parents are some of the best you could ask for.
        We were lucky enough that my mom got to stay home with us most of our childhood. My dad worked a normal 9-5 job and was home most weekends. Both of my parents stayed very involved in my life through highschool, and while they still live in Atlanta I keep up with them weekly.</p>

      <h3>Brother</h3>
      <img  src = "images/brother.jpg"></img>
      <p>My brother and I are 4 years apart. In the 90's we did not get along, as he was always copying me and driving me crazy. However as we grew up by the time I was in college and he was in highschool, he had become my best friend. He later went on to be the best man in my wedding.</p>
